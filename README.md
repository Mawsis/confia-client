# React Hotel eBooking App

## Overview

This is a React-based hotel eBooking application developed using Vite as the build tool, npm or pnpm for package management, Lucide React icons for UI components, and Neovim as the code editor.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/Mawsis/confia-client.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd confia
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   If using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This will launch the development server, and you can view the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory containing the optimized production build.

## Code Editor

This project is best viewed and edited using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). Ensure you have it installed and configured for an optimal development experience.
